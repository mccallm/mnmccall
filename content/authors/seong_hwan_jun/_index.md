I am interested in computational statistics, specifically Monte Carlo methods, as a means to achieve Bayesian inference. I develop Bayesian models and inference methods to solve problems from computational oncology, which includes integration of bulk genomics with single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell multi-modal data.
