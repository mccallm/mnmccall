Congratulations to Daniel Croft and David Burton on their paper entitled, The effect of air pollution on the transcriptomics of the immune response to respiratory infection.

Overall, this epidemiological study suggests that combustion related pollution, particularly black carbon, is associated with changes in gene expression within innate immune pathways. Increased concentrations in the majority of pollutants also appear to correspond to changes in expression to protein folding and iron homeostasis. Future controlled exposure studies informed by epidemiological studies are needed to further explore the relationship between inflammatory and immune responses to particulate air pollution in patients with respiratory infection.
