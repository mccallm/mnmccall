Congratulations to Zachary Brehm, Erik VonKaenel, and David Burton on their preprint entitled, Selection of inverse gamma and half-t priors for hierarchical models: sensitivity and recommendations.


<!--more-->

In this study, they found that the posterior distribution of the standard deviation had smaller bias under half-t priors than under their inverse-gamma counterparts; however, inverse gamma priors generally gave similar coverage but had smaller interval lengths than their half-t prior counterparts. Their results will inform prior specification for hierarchical models, allowing practitioners to better align their priors with their respective models and goals.
