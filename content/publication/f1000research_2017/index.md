abstract: "The miRcomp-Shiny web application allows interactive performance assessments and comparisons of qPCR-based microRNA expression and quality estimation methods using a benchmark data set. This work is motivated by two distinct use cases: (1) selection of methodology and quality thresholds for use analyzing one's own data, and (2) comparison of novel expression estimation algorithms with currently-available methodology. The miRcomp-Shiny application is implemented in the R/Shiny language and can be installed on any operating system on which R can be installed. It is made freely available as part of the miRcomp package (version 1.3.3 and later) available through the Bioconductor project at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRcomp. The web application is hosted at https://laurenkemperman.shinyapps.io/mircomp/. A detailed description of how to use the web application is available at: http://lkemperm.github.io/miRcomp_shiny_app"
